PROJECT TITLE: 7.02 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To use the ArrayList to store cheesecake objects.
VERSION or DATE: 2/4/21
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I was able to properly use an ArrayList to hold the objects of the cheesecake
class. I also created the object class with no problem, complete with the
constructor as well as calculation and getter methods.

Struggles and Overcoming Them:
The main thing that I struggled with was printing the information. I wasn't
entirely sure how I wanted to get all of the data from the ArrayList. Once I had
figured that out, the String.format() was also difficult. The modifiers are very
picky and in my opinion difficult to work with. It took some trial and error, but
I believe that the output looks nice now.
