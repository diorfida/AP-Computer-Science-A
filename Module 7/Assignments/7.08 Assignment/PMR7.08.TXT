PROJECT TITLE: 7.08 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Use OOP and algorithm tactics to create a gradebook.
VERSION or DATE: 2/7/21
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I was able to create the OOP Student class very efficiently. I found it easy to
create the instance variables, constructor, getter and setter methods, and the
toString method. In the tester class, I successfully used the ArrayList to store
Student objects. I was also able to create and use the methods for modifying the
ArrayList.

Struggles and Overcoming them:
The only thing that I really struggled with was keeping track of what was in the
ArrayList at each particular time. Other than that I was successful with all 
aspects of the project.
