PROJECT TITLE: 7.09 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To implement a sorting method for arrays.
VERSION or DATE: 2/8/21
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I was able to declare and use an array of Movies how intended. I declared the
static methods necessary for the sorting algorithms. I also created the sorting
algorithms and was able to use it with my array in the main method.

Struggles and Overcoming them:
My main struggle was making the sorting methods sort in reverse order. I didn't
immediately understand how the sorting algorithm worked in full, so that made it
difficult to then put it in reverse order. I then figured out that all I needed to
do was flip the greater than sign to less than to go in reserse order.
