PROJECT TITLE: 7.05 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To use traversals and replacements.
VERSION or DATE: 2/7/21
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I was able to set up my tester classes in the static method format with no issue. I
also was able to format the output table with very few issues compared to previous
assignments. The traversals and replacements were also pretty easy to implement
since they are almost the same types of loops used in previous lessons.

Struggles and Overcoming them:
There isn't really anything that I struggled with. The concept of the assignment
was basically a deeper dive into concepts that we had already learned. Overall I
really enjoyed the application of this assignment.
