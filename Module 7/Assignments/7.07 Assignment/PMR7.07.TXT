PROJECT TITLE: 7.07 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To use insertion and deletion methods.
VERSION or DATE: 2/7/21
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I was able to properly declare and use the static methods for inserting and
deleting array and ArrayList elements. I also printed the results without any
issues. I was able to create the insert algorithms easily.

Struggles and Overcoming them:
I struggled a bit with the concept of using null in the deletion methods. I ended
up of just thinking of it as a placeholder rather than modifying the entire size
of the array. I then had to fix everything so it wouldn't throw the null pointer
exception, which took some time to figure out. I eventually realized that all I
needed to do was check if the instance was null or not and then perform actions
based on that decision.
