PROJECT TITLE: 7.10 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To utilize selection sorts on arrays.
VERSION or DATE: 2/9/21
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I created the tester class and declared the methods with no issues. I also was able
to print the information for each movie to the output window easily. Lastly, I was
able to create and use the methods for sorting the array elements.

Struggles and Overcoming them:
I didn't really struggle with anything in this project. I found this method of
sorting array elements much easier than the insertion sort. The variables and
keeping track of them was much more straightforward in the selection sort, maybe
because I had previously worked with the similar but different concept in selection
sorting.
