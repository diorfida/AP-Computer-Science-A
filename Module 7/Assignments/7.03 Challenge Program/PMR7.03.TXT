PROJECT TITLE: 7.03 Challenge Program
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To determine and print data based on a set of hurricane data.
VERSION or DATE: 2/5/21
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I was able to structure the code that I needed to create an OOP program and tester
class. I also correctly used multiple arrays and an ArrayList of Hurricanes to
use that information for the output. I was also able to apply what I had previously
learned about integers and doubles to create the program to determine the min and
max value.

Struggles and overcoming them:
I had to rearange my program because I had put the code for determining the min,
max, and average before resizing the data based on the user input. This was a minor
setback, but it took a lot of time. The other main thing that I struggled with was
formatting the output, which took some time and was a bit confusing at the
beginning.
