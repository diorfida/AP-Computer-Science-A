PURPOSE OF PROJECT: APCSA Lab to use string methods and logic.
VERSION or DATE: 2/10/21
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I was able to follow the general idea of the new I want to and you me methods for
generating responses. I was able to add the new methods as well in the correct
spot for the program to properly function. I was also able to easily modify the
get random response method to utilize an array rather than going through a bunch
of if-else-if statements.

Struggles and Overcoming them:
The instructions and procedure were very clear and specific, therefore I did not
have any trouble with this lab.
