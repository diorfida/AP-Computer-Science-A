PROJECT TITLE: 4.07 Password Generator
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To use loops and text file strategies to create passwords with
user specifications.
VERSION or DATE: 10/28/20
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
From the start, I knew what classes I needed to import and initialize. I made sure
to throw the IOException since I was using a text file. I also knew that I was
going to need quite a few nested loops to achieve the project's goal. To my 
surprise I recalled and used the methods for text files without having to look back
at the lessons.

Struggles and Overcoming Them:
At first, I was using the proper statements to get where I needed to go, but it got
a bit more complicated once there were a lot of statements. Sometimes it was a bit
difficult to determine where a certain statement needed to go because there were so
many brackets. I decided to use comments to keep track of which loop is what. I did
struggle a bit with generating the password because I forgot to reset certain
counters and tokens after each individual use.
