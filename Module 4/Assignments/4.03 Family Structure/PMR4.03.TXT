PROJECT TITLE: 4.03 Family Structure
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To use text files and file methods to gather and use large data
sets.
VERSION or DATE: 10/20/20
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I was able to initialize and use all of the counter variables properly. That being
said, I also used the while loop as it is intended in this situation. I had the
concept of the while loop and counter down and used the file methods properly.

Struggles and Overcoming Them:
At first with the while loop and test file, I wasn't getting the correct number of
males and females, since I started with just those. In fact, I wasn't getting
anything. This was because I was using == instead of the equals() method. The other
big issue that I had was with printf to print to the proper number of decimal
places. I figured out that I kept getting the no modifier present error because I
was using a plus instead of a comma. Other than that I didn't have any major issues
and really enjoyed this project.
