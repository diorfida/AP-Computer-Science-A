PROJECT TITLE: 10.05 Fibonacci
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To use recursive algorithms to display the nth Fibonacci number
VERSION or DATE: 3/25/21
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I successfully created the OOP class needed to contain the Fibonacci finder method.
I also was able to apply a recursive algorithm to this situation in the form of a
piecewise function. I also created the menu screen output in a neat fashion.
Lastly, I found the bounds to where the program works on my computer's processor
and factored that into the menu.

Struggles and Overcoming them:
I believe that I fully understand the concept of recursion, but the only thing that
I "struggled" on was the scanner object because I forgot to import it. Other than
that I was fine.
