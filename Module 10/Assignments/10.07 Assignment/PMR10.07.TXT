PROJECT TITLE: 10.07 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To use array sorting algorithms and the new merge sort.
VERSION or DATE: 3/30/21
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I created the store item OOP class with no issues. I was able to implement each
different array sorting algorithm in the tester class's main method. I was also
successful at displaying the output in a neat table format.

Struggles and Overcoming them:
The merge sort was a little bit confusing at first since there is a lot going on,
but after studying it for some time and understanding the point of the recursive
calls and loops, I was able to implement it twice. Other than that I was extremely
successful with this project.
