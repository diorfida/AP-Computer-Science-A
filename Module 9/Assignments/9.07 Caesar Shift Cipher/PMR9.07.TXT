PROJECT TITLE: 9.07 Caesar Shift Cipher
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To implement a ceaser shift.
VERSION or DATE: 3/9/21
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I properly declared the two implementation classes and the client tester class. I
also created the menu for choosing between encryption, decryption, and quitting.
I was able to encrypt the alphabet pretty easily.

Struggles and Overcoming them:
When I first created the encrypt method in the Encryption class, it wasn't working
as intended. The key was right, but something about the algorithm was off. I
figured out that I needed to include a while loop in the else-if statement so that
the shift scale would be in bounds instead of a single statement.
