PROJECT TITLE: 9.02 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To practice extending classes.
VERSION or DATE: 2/25/21
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I was able to create each of the OOP objects for the different terrains and include
the extend keyword in the class definition. I also created the get methods for a
string of each of the different classes. Lastly, I was able to create a tester
class and print everything to the output screen.

Strugg
The only thing that I forgot is that the direct subclasses directly inherit the
methods from the extended class. When I went to use them, I was trying to search
for some variable that I could use to get the methods but they were already there.
Once I figured that out, I was all set.
