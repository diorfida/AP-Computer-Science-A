PROJECT TITLE: 9.08 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To use learned programming techniques to calculate the number
of prime numbers in a given set.

AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I was able to declare the classes and a method to calculate the prime numbers in
the object class. I also was able to set up the Scanner class for user input.
Furthermore, I created a general alogorithm for determining if a number was prime
or not, even though I struggled a bit at first. Lastly, I printed the results of
the program to the output screen.

Struggles and Overcoming them:
The main struggle that I had was with the prime determination algorithm. First, I
was getting all of the numbers returned, so I decided to remove the mod 1 so that
the program just started dividing the numbers by 2. Then, it was returning multiple
values for the same number. I decided to add a break statement in the if loop that
is inside of the nested for loop. Then, it was only returning the numbers that
weren't prime! I had to switch around my logic and use a temp integer so that if
that temp integer was greater than 0, the number would not be prime rather than
just adding it to the ArrayList directly.
