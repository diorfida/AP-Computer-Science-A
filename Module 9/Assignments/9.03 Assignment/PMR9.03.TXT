PROJECT TITLE: 9.03 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To demonstrate polymorphism with sample shape classes.
VERSION or DATE: 3/1/21
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I declared the circle objects as each of the shapes that they needed to be and
successfully put them into an ArrayList. I also properly created the getName
methods in each of the object classes. Lastly, I created the showCenter method
and passed each element of the ArrayList into it and printed the results to the
output screen.

Struggles and Overcoming Them:
There isn't really anything that I struggled with in this assignment. The concept
seemed super complicated in the eIMACS labs, but once I got into actually
practicing the concept of polymorphism I was good to go.
