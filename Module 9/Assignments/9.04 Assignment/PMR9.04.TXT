PROJECT TITLE: 9.04 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To override methods such as toString and equals.
VERSION or DATE: 3/3/21
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I properly declared all of the shape OOP classes and was able to use them in a
client class. I also was able to override the toString method for each pretty
easily.

Struggles and Overcoming them:
The hardest part for me was overriding the equals method. I struggled with using
the instanceof keyword at first, but that turned out to be no big deal. I was
trying to compare substrings of each object's toString methods, but that didn't
work how I wanted it to. I then figured out to just compare the instance variables
instead of the toString, which turned out to work much better than how I was
attempting it.
