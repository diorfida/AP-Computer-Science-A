PROJECT TITLE: Domenic Iorfida
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To use a 2D array to store and print information.
VERSION or DATE: 2/16/21
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I successfully created and used the 2D array of catapult objects. I also was able
to create the OOP catapult object class after some iteration. Lastly, I correctly
and neatly formatted the output table.

Struggles and Overcoming them:
The instructions for the assignment overall were somewhat confusing. The general
idea was pretty vague as to what belongs in which class. I had started out by
creating all of the arrays and even the 2D array in the OOP class when I later
figured out that it was supposed to go in the tester. This is why I feel that I
had to go through so many iterations of the object class.
