PROJECT TITLE: 8.02 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To use a binary search and sorting methods
VERSION or DATE: 2/11/21
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I was able to create the binary search methods. They were pretty easy to create,
even though at first I didn't entirely understand the concept. I also chose to use
selection sort methods to sort the array for the binary search, which I also
created easily.

Struggles and Overcoming them:
There wasn't really anything that I struggled with in this assignment. The hardest
part for me was keeping track of the main array and how it was sorted at each point
in the program, so I think documenting the code would help me a lot in the future.
