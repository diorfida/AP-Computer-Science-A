PROJECT TITLE: 5.08 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To create and use an object and its methods.
VERSION or DATE: 11/13/20
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I was able to create and use the constructor for my grade class with no problems.
This means that I was also able to initialize and use private entities within the
class. I also had no issue creating the methods to use. In the tester class, I
properly used the constructor to add three students to the program.

Struggles and Overcoming Them:
I am getting better at formatting output, but the \t keyword is still a bit
confusing to me. After some trial and error, I was able to make the output look
presentable. I also struggled a bit with the casting with the grade inputs, since I
had not done that in a while.
