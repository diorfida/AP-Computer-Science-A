PROJECT TITLE: 5.02 Defining New Methods
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To use static methods to print data about planets.
VERSION or DATE: 11/2/20
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
The concept of defining methods to run code through is not difficult, but it is
different than what I have gotten used to. I was able to define these methods and
use them how I believe they were supposed to be used. The method for determining
the surface gravity was a pretty straightforward formula to program. I also
remembered to use the Math.pow() function to raise certain numbers to a power
instead of continually multiplying.

Struggles and Overcoming Them:
The only thing that I struggled with in this assignment was formating the decimal
numbers to be printed, since I don't use printf() that often. Other than that this
project was pretty easy for me.
