PROJECT TITLE: 5.05 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To use a scenario of my choice to practice using default
constructors.
VERSION or DATE: 11/5/20
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I was able to properly use a default constructor to create this object. I also was
able to create some methods to implament and a main method without any issues.
Lastly, I also declared all of the necessary variables and used them properly in
the main method.

Struggles and Overcoming Them:
The only real issue I had with this project was the calculation; I kept getting
incorrect values because I was using the wrong calculation. The other thing I
messed up was using the wheel diameter. I didn't want to have to deal with any
casting, so I just decided to make this a double value. Other than that I was
successful and really enjoyed this project.
