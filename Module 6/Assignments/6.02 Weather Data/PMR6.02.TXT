PROJECT TITLE: 6.02 Weather Data
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To use arrays and printf to display weather data.
VERSION or DATE: 1/8/20
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I was able to initialize multiple static methods to compute the different totals
and averages as well as add and convert information inside of the arrays. Using
arrays was not very difficult for me; I understand the concept pretty well so far.
I was also able to initialize and use the scanner class for user input. After some
trial and error, I neatly formatted the output using printf.

Struggles and Overcoming Them:
The hardest part for me was using the identifiers in printf to display the output.
I struggled with remembering the concept of using the identifiers as intended,
since I had not yet "mastered" the identifiers. I kept forgetting certain things
like a percent or how to left align. I'm sure that I will get better at it as I
continue to use it.
