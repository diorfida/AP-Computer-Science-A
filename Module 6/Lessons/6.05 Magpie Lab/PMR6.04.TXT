PROJECT TITLE: 6.05 Magpie Lab
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To learn to use string methods on a broader scale
VERSION or DATE: 1/25/21
AUTHORS: Laurie White from College Board, Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I was able to use the new string methods without any issues. I was also able to
modify the source code for magpie to add output for pets and teacher names pretty
easily. The getResponse method was fairly easy to interpret. I had no trouble with
adding more random responses to the getRandomResponse method. Lastly, I
successfully modified the getResponse to include the findKeyword method instead of
the indexOf method for identifying keywords.

Struggles and Overcoming Them:
The findKeyword method was a little bit overwhelming at first. Performing a desk
check and thouroughly reading the lesson's guidance really helped me to understand
how it works.
