PROJECT TITLE: 1.09 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Work with ints and doubles.
VERSION or DATE: 9/4/20, V6
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
Right from the start, I was successful with the print statements from the previous
lessons. I also had known my operators and order of operations due to my prior
programming experience, so I didn't have much trouble with that.

Struggles and Overcoming Them:
My biggest thing was forgetting to include the plus + sign between the different
variables and strigs for concatenation. I would keep getting the syntax errors.

What I Need to Work on:
I just need to proofread and watch my syntax. If I work a bit more cautiously and
check what I'm doing at regular intervals instead of just running through replacing 
things, I would be a lot better off.
