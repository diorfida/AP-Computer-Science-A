PROJECT TITLE: 1.12 Grades
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Use arithmetic Java shortcuts to display test grades and other
grade information
VERSION or DATE: 9/9/20
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I was able to use the proper print statements right away. I knew the difference
between the print() and println() from previous practice. From the start, I also
had a pretty good idea of how I would calculate and display the information on
the output screen.

Challenges and Overcoming Them:
The surprise of being able to only use the variables provided confused me at first.
My initial instinct was to create a variable for each different grade and find the
other values through a for loop, which we haven't learned about yet. However, I 
quickly realized why the given variables were there (to practice with assignment 
and shortcuts), so I made use of those through what was given to me in the
lesson.

What I Need to Work On:
Sometimes it appears that I rush things without looking at what I'm already given,
so I just need to take a step back and examine what I'm given.
