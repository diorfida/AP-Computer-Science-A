Initial Successes:
I was able to use the if and else-if statements without any trouble, as well as
obtaining and parsing the inputs if necessary. Printing each of the necessary items
was also a success.

Struggles and Overcoming them:
My main issue was the math not coming out to where it should've. I knew what
conversions that I needed to do, but the BMI was always coming out to around 2. I 
figured out that I was converting the centimeters (derived from the inches) the
opposite way by multiplying by 10 rather than dividing by it. The other issue I
had was a slight parsing issue with the height input. When I tried to parse it, the
program would say that the input wasn't an integer. I realized that it was counting
the space, so I had to use the substring() method to fix that.
