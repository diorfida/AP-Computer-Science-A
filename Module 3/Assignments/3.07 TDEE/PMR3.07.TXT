PROJECT TITLE: 3.07 TDEE
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To create a program that uses string class techniques to
calculate the TDEE of some user inputs.

Initial Successes:
I think that the Scanner class and parsing is becoming second nature now. I was 
able to use all of the necessary methods properly. The calculation to get the TDEE
was esay to create as well.

Struggles and Overcoming Them:
The conditional statements weren't working like they were intended to. This was
because I was using the logical operator == rather than the equals() method for
strings. That quickly resolved itself. The method toUpperCase() wasn't working at
first as well, and this was because of an error I had made in naming the variables.
I had misspelled [I believe it was] activity, and when I went to use it the program
would break. Luckily, I was able to find that error and it worked from there.
Everything else went pretty well; I didn't have that much trouble.
