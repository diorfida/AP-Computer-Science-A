PROJECT TITLE: 2.03 Math Class Methods
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Use the methods in Java's Math class to calculate the length
of the hypotenuse of a triangle.
VERSION or DATE: 9/16/20
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
Given that finding the length of a missing side of a triangle is very common in 
math and robotic "odometry" programming, I knew what calculation I needed to 
perform and the methods that would get me there. I was also able to successfuly
perform string concatenation with the print statements.

Struggles and Overcoming Them:
The Math.random() function was a little bit tricky to work with; I didn't 
completley understand how to set the number bound at first. After reading it back 
in the lesson a few times, I was able to understand the nature of the random
method and why multiplying and adding was necessary.
