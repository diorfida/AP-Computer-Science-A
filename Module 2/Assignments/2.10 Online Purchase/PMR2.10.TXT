PROJECT TITLE: 2.10 Online Purchase - BuyMovieTickets
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To use what I have learned over the past two modules to create
a program to buy a movie ticket and print an e-reciept based on user input.
VERSION or DATE: 9/24/20
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida

Initial Successes:
I was able to initialize and use the scanner class methods with ease. I was also
able to use parsing somewhat correctly (more on that later). I additionally was
able to create all of the necessary variables to complete the e-reciept.

Struggles and Overcoming Them:
The main struggle for me with this project was using the string methods,
specifically the substring method. This was because I kept losing sight of the fact
that a string starts at index 0 and increases from there, rather than one. I also
sometimes forgot (but less frequently than the other one) that the substring
method's second paramater is noninclusive. After some troubleshooting with print
statements, I was able to get these figured out.
