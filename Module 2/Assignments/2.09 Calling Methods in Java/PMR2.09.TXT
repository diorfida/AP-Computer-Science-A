PROJECT TITLE: Making Method Calls
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To use static methods to print the results of some mathematical
items to the screen.
VERSION or DATE: 9/23/20
AUTHORS: Domenic Iorfida, APCS Team

Initial Successes:
The methods that were provided for this project were very straightforward and it
was easy to understand what was going on with them. Some of them had integer inputs
and some of them just printed the intended statement. One of them also had an 
integer return statement. The javadoc comments throughout the main method were also
straightforward and easy to understand what task needed to be accomplished.

Struggles and Overcoming Them:
I didn't really struggle with anything in this assignment. I had already had some
knowledge of how to write and use methods, so I was able to tell what was going on
in each method and how I would use it.
